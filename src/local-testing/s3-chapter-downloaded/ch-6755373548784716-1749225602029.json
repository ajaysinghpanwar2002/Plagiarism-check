My mouth won't scream. Only bubbles rise as everything blurs around me.<br>I feel small. Helpless. Like I'm eight again.<br><br>I try to fight-<br>But my body... it's so tired.<br>So tired.<br><br>Maybe this is it.<br>Maybe this is how I die.<br><br>No... I'm only eight...<br>God, please-please don't let this be it.<br>Please save me. I don't want to go like this.<br><br>The water feels alive, angry.<br>It hates me.<br>It wants to swallow me whole.<br><br>No... please...<br>I don't want to disappear.<br>I don't want to be forgotten.<br><br>Someone...<br>Anyone...<br>Please-help me.<br><br>And then-<br><br>A hand.<br>It breaks through the water.

I don't remember his face.<br>But I know this-<br><br>That hand once saved me.<br>And a part of me... is still waiting to feel it again.<br><br>\"Aru... what happened? That dream again? Are you okay, baby?\"<br>I hear Divya's soft, worried voice.<br><br>She's already on my bed, eyes full of concern.<br>I nod slowly. \"That dream again...\" I whisper, my voice shaking.<br><br>Without a word, she wraps her arms around me.<br>I bury myself in her warmth, letting her hold me like she always does.<br><br>\"Shh... don't worry, Aru. Everything's going to be fine. You're safe with me.\"<br>Her voice is gentle, but I can hear the worry hidden behind it.<br><br>Tears roll down my cheeks. I don't even know when I started crying.<br><br>Divya holds me tighter.

I wake up at the same time.<br>Five a.m.<br><br>Why?<br>Why does it always happen at the same time?<br>What really happened that night?<br><br>But no matter how hard I try...<br>I can't remember.<br><br>\"Go back to sleep, baby,\" Divya says softly, pulling me back into bed. \"It's Sunday. You need rest. I'm staying right here with you.\"<br><br>She lies down beside me, her arms still around me.<br>And slowly, I let myself drift again-<br>Held.<br>Safe.<br>But still haunted.<br><br>______________________________________<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you so much for reading &#129392;&#10084;&#65039;, hope you like this chapter.
